		<name>Haunted One</name>
		<proficiency/>
		<trait>
			<name>Description</name>
			<text>You are haunted by something so terrible that you dare not speak of it. You've tried to bury it and run away from it, to no avail. Whatever this thing is that haunts you can't be slain with a sword or banished with a spell. It might come to you as a shadow on the wall, a bloodcurdling nightmare, a memory that refuses to die, or a demonic whisper in the dark. The burden has taken its toll, isolating you from most people and making you question your sanity. You must find a way to overcome it before it destroys you.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Arcana, Investigation, Religion, or Survival</text>
			<text>• Languages: Choose two, one of which must be Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon</text>
			<text>• Equipment: A monster hunter's pack (containing a chest, a crowbar, a hammer, three wooden stakes, a holy symbol, a flask of holy water, a set of manacles, a steel mirror, a flask of oil, a tinderbox, and 3 torches), one trinket of special significance (choose one or roll on the Horror Trinkets table later in this chapter), a set of common clothes, and 1 sp.</text>

			<name>Harrowing Event</name>
			<text>Prior to becoming an adventurer, your path in life was defined by one dark moment, one fateful decision, or one tragedy. Now you feel a darkness threatening to consume you, and you fear there may be no hope of escape. Choose a harrowing event that haunts you, or roll one on the Harrowing Events table.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 | Event</text>
			<text>1 | A monster that slaughtered dozens of innocent people spared your life, and you don't know why.</text>
			<text>2 | You were born under a dark star. You can feel it watching you, coldly and distantly. Sometimes it beckons you in the dead of night.</text>
			<text>3 | An apparition that has haunted your family for generations now haunts you. You don't know what it wants, and it won't leave you alone.</text>
			<text>4 | Your family has a history of practicing the dark arts. You dabbled once and felt something horrible clutch at your soul, whereupon you fled in terror.</text>
			<text>5 | An oni took your sibling one cold, dark night, and you were unable to stop it.</text>
			<text>6 | You were cursed with lycanthropy and later cured. You are now haunted by the innocents you slaughtered.</text>
			<text>7 | A hag kidnapped and raised you. You escaped, but the hag still has a magical hold over you and fills your mind with evil thoughts.</text>
			<text>8 | You opened an eldritch tome and saw things unfit for a sane mind. You burned the book, but its words and images are burned into your psyche.</text>
			<text>9 | A fiend possessed you as a child. You were locked away but escaped. The fiend is still inside you, but now you try to keep it bottled up.</text>
			<text>10 | You did terrible things to avenge the murder of someone you loved. You became a monster, and it haunts your waking dreams.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Feature: Heart of Darkness</name>
			<text>Those who look into your eyes can see that you have faced unimaginable horror and that you are no stranger to darkness. Though they might fear you, commoners will extend you every courtesy and do their utmost to help you. Unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them, they will even take up arms to fight alongside you, should you find yourself facing an enemy alone.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Suggested Characteristics</name>
			<text>You have learned to live with the terror that haunts you. You are a survivor, who can be very protective of those who bring light into your darkened life.</text>

			<text>12 | I'm easily startled, but I'm not a coward.</text>
			<text/>

			<text>1 | Adrenaline. I've experienced such strangeness that now I feel alive only in extreme situations.</text>

			<text>4 | I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out.</text>
			<text>5 | I am exceptionally credulous and believe any story or legend immediately.</text>
			<text>6 | I'm a skeptic and don't believe in the power of rituals, religion, superstition, or spirits.</text>
			<text>7 | I know my future is written and that anything I do will lead to a prophesied end.</text>
			<text>8 | I need to find the best in everyone and everything, even when that means denying obvious malice.</text>
			<text>9 | I've seen the evil of a type of place—like forests, cities, or graveyards—and resist going there.</text>
			<text>10 | I'm exceptionally cautious, planning laboriously and devising countless contingencies.</text>
			<text>11 | I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows.</text>
			<text>12 | I know the ends always justify the means and am quick to make sacrifices to attain my goals.</text>

		<name>Investigator (Van Richten's)</name>
		<proficiency/>
		<trait>
			<name>Description</name>
			<text>You relentlessly seek the truth. Perhaps you're motivated by belief in the law and a sense of universal justice, or maybe that very law has failed you and you seek to make things right. You could have witnessed something remarkable or terrible, and now you must know more about this hidden truth. Or maybe you're a detective for hire, uncovering secrets for well-paying clients. Whether the mysteries you're embroiled in are local crimes or realm-spanning conspiracies, you're driven by a personal need to hunt down even the most elusive clues and reveal what others would keep hidden in the shadows.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Skill Proficiencies: Choose two from among Insight, Investigation, or Perception</text>
			<text>• Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit, thieves' tools</text>
			<text>• Equipment: A magnifying glass, evidence from a past case (choose one or roll for a trinket from the Horror Trinkets table later in this chapter), a set of common clothes, and 10 gp</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Path to Mystery</name>
			<text>Your first case influenced the types of mysteries you're interested in. Why was this case so impactful, personal, or traumatic? Whom did it affect besides you? Why and how did you get involved? Was it solved? How did it set you on the path to investigating other mysteries? Roll on or choose details from the First Case table to develop the mystery that started your career as an investigator.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d8 | Case</text>
			<text>1 | A friend was wrongfully accused of murder. You tracked down the actual killer, proving your friend's innocence and starting your career as a detective.</text>
			<text>2 | You're told you went missing for weeks. When you were found, you had no memory of being gone. Now you search to discover what happened to you.</text>
			<text>3 | You helped a spirit find peace by finding its missing corpse. Ever since, other spectral clients have sought you out to help them find rest.</text>
			<text>4 | You revealed that the monsters terrorizing your home were illusions created by a cruel mage. The magic-user escaped, but you've continued to uncover magical hoaxes.</text>
			<text>5 | You were wrongfully accused and convicted of a crime. You managed to escape and seek to help others avoid the experience you suffered, even while still being pursued by the law.</text>
			<text>6 | You survived the destructive use of a magic device that wiped out your home. Members of a secret organization found you. You now work with them, tracking down dangerous supernatural phenomena and preventing them from doing harm.</text>
			<text>7 | You found evidence of a conspiracy underpinning society. You tried to expose this mysterious cabal, but no one believed you. You're still trying to prove what you know is true.</text>
			<text>8 | You got a job with an agency that investigates crimes that local law enforcement can't solve. You often wonder which you value more, the truth or your pay.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Feature: Official Inquiry</name>
			<text>You're experienced at gaining access to people and places to get the information you need. Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.</text>
